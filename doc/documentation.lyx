Introduction

\begin_layout Standard

Wavy is a sensory substitution software package.
 Sensory substitution is defined by Wikipedia as :
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quote

\size larger
[A process that mean] to transform the characteristics of one sensory modality
 into stimuli of another sensory modality.
 It is hoped that sensory substitution systems can help handicapped people
 by restoring their ability to perceive a certain defective sensory modality
 by using sensory information from a functioning sensory modality.

Wavy is primarily intended to be a visual-to-sound substitution system.
 However it is designed to be an easily extendable framework in order to
 develop other types of sensory substitution system.
 Wavy main goals are :

\begin_layout Enumerate

using an agile and multi-platform language (python)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate

developping a general and flexible framework for sensory substitution

Python was choose for its ability to be very powerfull and extensible.
 It favorise experimentation and rapid developpment of new ideas/features.
 It provide a large collection of standard and third-party packages in many
 fields (GUI, games, numerical computation etc.).
 After prototyping, code can be profiled and bottlnecks could be moved in
 C/C++ code.

Overview
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
The Retina and ReceptiveField clases
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\size larger
Retina object is the core of the sensory substitution system.
 It is composed of several receptive fields which determine the layout of
 the spatial sampling and define the way the output is done.
 At each times, the substitution is realised from an input field (usually
 a numpy array or a reference to a numpy array), representing input data
 stream, according to all (simultaneously) receptive fields setup into the
 Retina.
 Retina initialization depend on a retina file, usually a wavy.ret text file
 which can be constructed using Utils.py methods (an example is available
 in the data directory, see Utils.py self documentation for more details)
 and others parameters related to the output (see WavyGame class section).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
The WavyGame class
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\size larger
This class is a general wrapper which aims to help you constucting new sensory
 substitution software.
 It manage all step needed to setup the sensory substitution system, initialize
 display, fecthing configuration file and so on, accodringly to your purpose.
 It rely on a configuration file, usually : wavy.conf but another could be
 specified (an example is available in the data directory).
