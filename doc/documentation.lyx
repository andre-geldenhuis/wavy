Introduction

\begin_layout Standard

Wavy is a sensory substitution software package.
 Sensory substitution is defined by Wikipedia as :
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quote

\size larger
[A process that mean] to transform the characteristics of one sensory modality
 into stimuli of another sensory modality.
 It is hoped that sensory substitution systems can help handicapped people
 by restoring their ability to perceive a certain defective sensory modality
 by using sensory information from a functioning sensory modality.

Wavy is primarily intended to be a visual-to-sound substitution system.
 However it is designed to be an easily extendable framework in order to
 develop other types of sensory substitution system.

So what's the difference with Wavy and why another sensory substitution
 package ? Others sensory substitution systems are coded in C/C++ or Java
 programming language and are designed to be used as an end user application.
 Instead, Wavy is designed as a framework to develop new ideas in the sensory
 substitution field.
 Main goals are

using an agile and multi-platform language

developping a general framework for sensory substitution with great extendable

to be very flexible in context of usage (gaming, scientific research, R&D
 or why not real life)

Python was choose for its ability to be very powerfull and extensible.
 It favorise experimentation and rapid developpment of new ideas/features.
 It provide a large collection of quality standard and third-party packages
 in many fields (GUI, games, numerical computation etc.).
 After prototyping, code can be profiled and bottlnecks could be moved in
 C/C++ code.

Quick start
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\size larger
You can easily start using wavy :
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate

\size larger
Unpack archive
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate

\size larger
run a game demo (*Demo.py files)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\size larger
You can also run theWave which sonify a webcam input (obviously, need a
 webcam).

Please check your Python installation, see installation section bellow for
 more details.

Installation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\size larger
If you just want to play with Wavy, the easier solution is to unpack the
 content of the archive and run provided toys programs (like test.py for
 example).
 Instead, if you want to use Wavy in a more flexible manner, or within a
 developpment perspective it's better to install properly the Wavy package
 in your Python environment.
 In this case, please follow these steps : 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate

\size larger
unpack the archive 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate

\size larger
run "python setup.py install" command in a terminal from the src directory.
 Please see the distutils documentation online for more details on this
 command.
